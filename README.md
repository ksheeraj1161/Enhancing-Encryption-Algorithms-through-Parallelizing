# Enhancing-Encryption-Algorithms-through-Parallelizing

To reduce the total computation time needed to complete the Encryption Algorithms process by parallelizing the algorithm using the concept of multi-threading. 
Encryption algorithms compose of necessary steps involving a key that helps convert plain text to cipher text.
The complexity, data structures and the overall procedure of the algorithm would remain constant.

- Rivest Cipher 5
- RSA
- International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)
